<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am an Electrical Engineering student at the University of Engineering and Technology (New Campus). Passionate about AI, automation, and embedded systems, I am currently in my third year, working on innovative projects integrating microcontrollers, AI, and digital signal processing.</p>

<p>With hands-on experience in STM32 microcontrollers, AI-driven applications, and robotics, I have developed projects like an Autonomous Robotic Vehicle and an AI-Powered Search & Rescue Robot. My expertise extends to SEO, soft skills, and productivity-enhancing technologies.</p>

<p>Previously, I completed an internship at Nimir Chemical Industry, where I gained industry experience in engineering applications. I am continuously learning and refining my skills to contribute to cutting-edge technological advancements.</p>

<p>I am also currently pursuing Web Development, enrolled in the Complete Web Development Bootcamp. This course is one of the highest-rated on Udemy, with over 150,000+ ratings and a 4.8 average. It covers front-end and back-end technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Node.js, React.js, SQL, and even blockchain technology.</p>

<p>By the end of this course, I aim to become a full-stack web developer, capable of building professional websites and web applications. I am excited about combining my engineering expertise with web development to create innovative solutions.</p>
